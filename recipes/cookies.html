You'll find a detailed ingridient list and step by step instructions in the recipe below
</p>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Butter: This peanut butter cookie recipe starts with two sticks of unsalted butter</li>
    <br>
    <li>Peanut butter: This recipe calls for crunchy peanut butter, but you can use smooth if you'd prefer</li>
    <br>
    <li>Sugars: A blend of white and brown sugars creates the perfect sweet, warm flavor</li>
    <br>
    <li>Eggs: Two eggs lend moisture and act as a binder, which means they help hold the dough together</li>
    <br>
    <li>Flour: All-purpose flour gives the dough structure</li>
    <br>
    <li>Leaveners: Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the cookies rise</li>
    <br>
    <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cookies taste salty</li>

</ul>
<br>
<ol>
    <li>Make the dough: Beat the butter, peanut butter, and sugars together. Beat in the eggs. Sift the dry ingredients together, then add to the wet mixture</li>
    <br>
    <li>Roll into balls: Chill the dough to make it easier to work with. Roll the dough into balls, place on a baking sheet, flatten with a fork, and make a criss cross pattern</li>
    <br>
    <li>Bake the cookies: Bake the cookies until golden, then cool on a wire rack</li>
</ol>
